LG TV power management via RS-232

## About

This utility can automatically turn on or off LG TV like a common monitor.

## Problem

When you connect your LG TV to PC you must every time use remote to turn it on or off.
Some TV's can be turned on via LAN/WIFI protocol. Mine doesn't. My TV shutting down LAN and WIFI cards when going off.
TV can be powered on by HDMI protocol, but NVIDIA (AMD) cards doesn't support this feature.
